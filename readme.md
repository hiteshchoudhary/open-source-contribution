# <Your-Project-Title> 

# koi BKL ü§° hi hoga jo yha contribute nhi Krega . ü§ë


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

# koi BKL ü§° hi hoga jo yha contribute nhi Krega . ü§ë

# Hwllo


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

# koi BKL ü§° hi hoga jo yha contribute nhi Krega . ü§ë


List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

---

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

# koi BKL ü§° hi hoga jo yha contribute nhi Krega . ü§ë


Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

The open source community spirit is all about:

Collaboration: Working together freely on shared goals, from code contributions to documentation and support.
Transparency: Openness to ideas, feedback, and even the code itself, fostering trust and innovation.
Sharing: Giving back to the community by contributing time, skills, and knowledge, empowering others.
Inclusivity: Welcoming newcomers with diverse backgrounds and expertise, valuing every contribution.
Impact: Striving to create something bigger than individual interests, building meaningful solutions together.

# Distributed Systems Overview

## Characteristics

1. **Resource Sharing**: Nodes in the distributed system can share resources like data, processing power, and storage.
2. **Concurrency**: Multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously in a distributed system.
3. **Scalability**: It can easily accommodate the addition of more nodes to handle increasing loads.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Failure of one node does not lead to the failure of the entire system.
5. **Transparency**: Users perceive the distributed system as a single coherent system, hiding the distribution of resources.
6. **Heterogeneity**: Nodes in the system may have different hardware, operating systems, and programming languages.

## Application Areas

1. **Finance and Commerce**: Online banking, stock trading platforms.
2. **Information Society**: Social media networks.
3. **Cloud Technology**: SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) services.
4. **Entertainment**: Streaming platforms, online gaming.
5. **Healthcare**: Electronic medical records systems, telemedicine platforms.

## Advantages

1. Nodes can easily share data with each other.
2. Scalability allows for the addition of more nodes.
3. Fault tolerance ensures system reliability.
4. Resources like printers can be shared among multiple nodes.

## Disadvantages

1. Security can be challenging to ensure across all nodes and connections.
2. Data loss can occur during transmission between nodes.
3. Managing the database in a distributed system can be complex.
4. Network overloading may happen if all nodes attempt to send data simultaneously.

## Design Challenges

- **Network Creation**: Establishing connections between nodes.
- **Computer Hardware Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across different hardware configurations.
- **Operating Systems**: Handling diverse operating systems on various nodes.
- **Programming Languages**: Supporting different programming languages used by nodes.
- **Implementation Consistency**: Ensuring consistency in system implementation across different developers.
- **Openness**: Extensibility and re-implementation of the system with shared resources.
- **Security**: Protecting against unauthorized access, interference, and data alteration or corruption.

## how to contribute on open-source projects
1. Search for an open-source project on GitHub related to your field of interest (e.g., MERN, React, etc.).
2. Look for bugs, features to add, corrections, or other areas where you can contribute to the project.
3. Fork the repository into your GitHub account.
4. Clone the forked repository to your local machine (e.g., using VS Code or any other editor).
5. Fix, add, remove, or contribute to the project locally.
6. Push your changes to GitHub using the traditional process. However, as a best practice, create a new branch (other than the main branch) and push your changes there.
7. Go to your forked repository and look for the "Compare & Pull Request" option. Click on it, and you will be directed to a screen with a message box.
8. Include details about the issue you fixed or the features you added, and then submit by clicking "Create Pull Request."
9. Wait for the project owner to review your pull request and add it, or provide feedback.
10. I am following these steps to contribute to open-source projects.

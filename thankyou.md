# Doing my first PR
This is my first pull request and i am trying this after completing your video about **Complete GIT in 1 video** (https://youtu.be/tz82ola3oy0?si=nD7RuoS_HlwOCa7H) as mentioned we can do any pull request on this repository so did with a readme file. And learning how to do so. Also it feels great learning from you sir.

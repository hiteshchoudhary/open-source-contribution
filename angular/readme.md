# Angular

## Introduction

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications. Angular's architecture is based on certain fundamental concepts like components, modules, services, and dependency injection.

## Basic Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Install the Angular CLI globally:
    npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Create a new Angular project:
    ng new my-angular-app

4. Navigate to your project directory:
    cd my-angular-app

5. Serve the application:
    ng serve

    Your Angular application will now be running on `http://localhost:4200`.

## Common Use Cases and Examples

Angular is a powerful framework suitable for various types of web applications. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Enterprise-scale Applications**: Angular's robust architecture makes it ideal for large, complex applications.

2. **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Angular provides built-in support for creating PWAs.

3. **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Angular excels at creating dynamic SPAs with smooth navigation.

4. **Real-time Applications**: When combined with technologies like WebSockets, Angular can be used to build real-time applications.

### Example: A Simple Angular Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
selector: 'app-hello',
template: `<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>`
})
export class HelloComponent {
name: string = 'Angular';
}

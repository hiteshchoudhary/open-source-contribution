Important characteristics of Digital System are as following below:

Data is represented in a digital system as a vector of binary variables.
Digital Systems can provide accuracy (dynamic range) limited only by the number of bits used to represent a variable
Digital systems are less prone to error than analog systems.
Data representation in a digital system is suitable for error detection and correction.
Digital systems are designed in a hierarchical manner using re-usable modules.
Benefits of Digital over Analog System: There are some reasons why we use Digital representation than Analog System:

It is economical and easy to design.
It is very well suited for both numerical and non-numerical information processing.
It has high noise immunity.
It is easy to duplicate similar circuits and complex digital ICs are manufactured with the advent of microelectronics Technology.
Adjustable precision and easily controllable by Computer.

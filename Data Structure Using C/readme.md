# Data Structures in C

Welcome to the **Data Structures in C** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of essential data structures implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand, learn, or improve their knowledge of fundamental data structures through practical examples.

## About the Project

The **Data Structures in C** project aims to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented code implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented from scratch to help users understand its underlying mechanics, making it a great learning tool for computer science students, beginners in programming, or anyone interested in mastering data structures.


## Folder Structure

Each data structure has its own folder containing:
- The main implementation file (`*.c` file).

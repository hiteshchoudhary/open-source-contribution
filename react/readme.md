# React "Hello World" Project
#Shafi-Anwar
This project serves as a simple introduction to the basics of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This is the view in MVC (Model View Controller) template. It can be used with any other JavaScript library or framework, like Angular JS in MVC.

## What is React?

React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. React projects are typically built with Node.js. You can download and install Node.js and npm from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Creating a New React Project

To create a new React project, we use the `create-react-app` CLI tool. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a good developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app hello-world
```

This command creates a new React application with the name "hello-world" and installs all the necessary dependencies. npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.


## Running the React App
After the installation is complete, you can start the React application by changing the directory to your new app and running the start script:

```bash
cd hello-world
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. You should see your app running. The page will reload when you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Understanding the Project Structure
Upon creating your new React app using create-react-app, you'll have the following file structure:

```bash
hello-world/
  node_modules/
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
  .gitignore
  package.json
  README.md
```

The most important files and directories are:


- `public/index.html` - The single HTML file where your React app is rendered.
- `src/index.js` - The JavaScript entry point for your React app.
- `src/App.js` - The default React component that serves as the main view of your app.

## Editing the App

To change the app's content, open src/App.js in your code editor and edit the file. For example, replace the content inside the <p> tag with "Hello, World!" and save the file. The changes will automatically reload in your browser.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <p>
          Hello, World!
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# React with Vite

## Introduction

React with Vite combines the power of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with Vite, a modern, lightning-fast build tool. Vite provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects, making it an excellent alternative to Create React App for React development.

## Basic Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js (version 12 or higher) and npm installed on your system.

2. Create a new React project using Vite:
    npm create vite@latest my-react-vite-app -- --template react

3. Navigate to your project directory:
    cd my-react-vite-app

4. Install dependencies:
    npm install

5. Start the development server:
    npm run dev


Your React application will now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Common Use Cases and Examples

React with Vite is suitable for various web application types, particularly where build performance is crucial. Common use cases include:

1. **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Quickly build and develop SPAs with fast refresh times.

2. **Static Site Generation**: Use Vite's pre-rendering capabilities for static site generation.

3. **Large-scale Applications**: Benefit from Vite's fast build times in larger React projects.

4. **Component Libraries**: Develop and test React component libraries efficiently.

### Example: A Simple React Component with Vite

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

return (
 <div>
   <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
   <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
     Click me
   </button>
 </div>
)
}

export default Counter

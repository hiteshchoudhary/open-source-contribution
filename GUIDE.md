## Getting Started

Thank you for taking your first step into the world of open source contributions! We appreciate your interest and enthusiasm.

### Contributing Guidelines

If you would like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new folder for your contribution.
2. If you prefer to contribute a markdown file or don't have any major thing to contribute then, you can do so in the `~/open-source-contribution/random-contribution` folder.

We value your contributions and look forward to seeing your work. Happy coding!
